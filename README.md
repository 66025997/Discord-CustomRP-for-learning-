# Custom Discord Rich Presence Manager
![App Banner](https://www.customrp.xyz/assets/screenshot.png)

Custom Discord Rich Presence Manager for Windows. Some of its features are run on startup and tray minimization. Uses [Lachee's DiscordRPC for C#](https://github.com/Lachee/discord-rpc-csharp).

## Downloading and setting up
Download the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/maximmax42/Discord-CustomRP/releases) page and run the .exe installer! You can also use Windows Package Manager to install the program (`winget install maximmax42.CustomRP`). Or, if you prefer the portable version, download the zip, unpack it somewhere, preferably in a separate folder, and start it up. Upon starting, you will be prompted to open a setup manual. You can open it later by pressing F1 or going Help -> Open Manual.
### Updating
If you installed the app, updating is literally as easy as running the installer for the newer version. If you use a portable version, please make sure to extract updated files into the same folder as you did before to keep your settings.
### Troubleshooting & Feedback
If you have any problems with the app, please check out [FAQ](https://github.com/maximmax42/Discord-CustomRP/wiki/FAQ) first. If it doesn't help, or you have suggestions on making the app more functional, you can open an issue ticket, use Discussions, or contact me on Discord - maximmax42#5572.
