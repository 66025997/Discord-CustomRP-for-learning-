# Custom Discord Rich Presence Manager
![App Banner](https://customrp.maximmax42.ru/assets/screenshot.png)

Custom Discord Rich Presence Manager for Windows. Some of its features are run on startup and tray minimization. Uses [Lachee's DiscordRPC for C#](https://github.com/Lachee/discord-rpc-csharp).

## Downloading and setting up
Download the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/maximmax42/Discord-CustomRP/releases) page and run the .exe installer! Or, if you prefer the portable version, download the zip, unpack it somewhere, preferably in a separate folder, and start it up. Upon starting, you will be prompted to open a setup manual. You can open it later by pressing F1 or going Help -> Open Manual.
### Updating
If you installed the app, updating is literally as easy as running the installer for the newer version. If you use a portable version, please make sure to extract updated files into the same folder as you did before to keep your settings.

## Translations
So far, the app supports these languages:
* English
* German (thanks to [Ypsol](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxGqMDnXnEyVt4yugLeBpgA))
* Russian

If you know how to localize apps in Visual Studio, go ahead and do that, and send a pull request. If you don't - open an issue about wanting to participate with translation and I'll hook you up with strings to translate.

## Feedback
If you have any problems with the app, or you have suggestions on making it more functional, you can open an issue ticket, or contact me on Discord - maximmax42#5572.
